We are the Costco E-Commerce Fulfillment Development team. We belong to larger e-commerce family. Above, you can see an image depicting the legacy sales model previously implemented by our company. As the leading development team at Costco, we feel a heavy responsibility to document all of our knowledge and general supremacy. As the superior development team, shirking responsibility is not in our playbook. So, we followed the only reasonable path and founded this repository. 

This page should include everything we know. The articles will be illuminating and extensive. We wish you well and recognize that existing in the shadow of our team is difficult. We are sorry. Perhaps the knowledge held deep in these pages will convince you to join us, here on the top of the mountain.
