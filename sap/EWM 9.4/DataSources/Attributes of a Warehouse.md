| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| LGNUM                           | Warehouse Number/Warehouse Complex                | /SCWM/T300      | LGNUM                        |

##### Extractor Logic

The fields in the table of origin for the extract structure largely consist of a 1:1 relation to data-based fields. For an explanation of how the other fields are instead determined by the extractor, see the table below.

| Fields in the Extract Structure | Field Determined by Extractor                                |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| TZONE                           | Determined by extractor of the supply chain unit of the warehouse. |
